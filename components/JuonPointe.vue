            <h2>Juon Pointe Shoe Fitting</h2>
            <p>The Juon Pointe Shoe Fitting system (affiliated with the Dancers Wellness Project) is a system designed through years of research by master fitter Esther Juon and her team of physiotherapists, osteopaths, podiatrists and ballet teachers. The system illuminates the skill that a fitter requires and the responsibility/duty of care necessary within the profession.</p>
            <p>Juon Pointe is a unique system that encourages the intrinsic foot muscles to engage correctly, lengthening through the toes (assisting alignment), supports the joints in the forefoot to aid in protecting the developing growth plates of maturing young dancers, and provides maximum support for professional ballerinas.</p>
            <p>The system also minimizes the impact of pointe and aids to prevent callus development, blisters or bruising of the toes</p>
            <p>The Juon Pointe system works in conjunction with the fitting of handmade Grishko Russian Pointe Shoes.</p>
            <p>The importance of precise fitting of pointe or demi–pointe shoes cannot be over emphasised. Fitting pointe shoes for the very first time will take a bit of time and patience on your behalf. It should never be rushed. The fitting of our pointe shoes is through a system developed over the last 25 years and is based on the following anatomical facts.​</p>

​            <p><strong>Three point support system of the foot:</strong></p>
            <p>The foot has a natural three-point support system and when the foot moves onto demi–pointe, the three points of support move to a new position.</p>
            <p>However when the foot goes fully onto pointe the three points of support are lost entirely so the pointe shoe must replace the three points of support to the dancers foot.</p>
            <p>The shoe has to be fitted as tightly as possible, not allowing the foot to slip down inside the shoe, causing damage to the toe joints and the feet in particular.</p>
            <p>To further protect the dancer's feet each toe and the metatarsal heads will be taped for support as well as protection against rubbing of the skin during pointe work.</p>            
            <p>The fitter will be working closely with the dancer's feedback and it is important that the dancer reports what s/he can feel and experience.</p>
